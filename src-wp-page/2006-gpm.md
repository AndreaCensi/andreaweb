**Abstract** -- 
 This paper describes an interpretation of scan 
matching as a probability distribution approximation 
problem and proposes an algorithm that, employing 
a particle approximation to the target distribution, can 
take advantage of the knowledge of the evolution model 
and provide an estimate of the matching uncertainty. 
Experiments show it can work in unstructured environments, 
it is reliable to severe sensor occlusions and it 
handles under constrained situations gracefully.
