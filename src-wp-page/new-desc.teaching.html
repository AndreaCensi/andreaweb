  <li>For Spring 2016, I am designing a new class on <em>"Unified Autonomous Robotics: Design your own self-driving car</em>",
    together with 
    <a href="">John Leonard</a>, 
    <a href="">Liam Paull</a>, 
    <a href="">Luca Carlone</a>, 
    <a href="">Dmitry Yershov</a>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>This is in the spirit of the 
    	<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-01-unified-engineering-i-ii-iii-iv-fall-2005-spring-2006/">
        	<em>Unified Engineering</em>
        </a> sequence offered in <a href="http://aeroastro.mit.edu/">AeroAstro</a>.</p>
   
   	<p class='for for-MIT'>MIT students: we are looking for TAs.</p>

<li>I am the most senior person around who actually has (some) time to organize stuff. I helped organize the LIDS Teas, a weekly informal chalk talk series, The Joint Inference and Control summer meetings, and currently the LIDS SDIL (Summer Dynamics &amp; Information Lunches).  
  <p class='for for-MIT'>
  MIT students: let me know if you have some cool idea, and we'll make it happen.
  </p>
  <p class='for for-outside'>People outside of LIDS: these informal speaking opportunities are a great way to start engaging with LIDS. Please contact me should you want to participate.</p>
