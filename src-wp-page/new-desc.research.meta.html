<h3>3. Meta-robotics</h3>

<p> A recent interest of mine is thinking about 
 a "second-order" theory of robotics applications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource-aware applications</li>
<li>Parallelization patterns and other computational issues</li> 
<li>Manipulation aof computation graphs to add functionality or improve robustness</li>
</ul>
<!-- 
  <p>My research is guided by these questions:</p>
    <ul>

      <li><em>Theory:</em> 
      What are the abstractions useful?

      </li>

      <li><em>Algorithms:</em> 
      	How can we optimize each application with respect to particular
      	resource constraints?
      </li>

      <li><em>Systems:</em> 

          How can we design "one-click" augmentation routines 
          that add functionality to an existing application?
      </li>

    </ul> -->
