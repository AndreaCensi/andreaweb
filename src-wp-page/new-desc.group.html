<h3>Group</h3>

<p>My group is currently isomorphic to the empty set. (I co-advise students in <a href="">Emilio's group</a>.)</p>

<p>

</p>

<p class="for for-MIT">
	MIT students: There is funding available for MIT PhD/MS students who want to work with me. Please contact
  me if interested.
</p>

<div class="for for-non-MIT">

<p>
	Non-MIT students: It is not impossible to find a way for you to come work here, however, 
    understand that it is really competitive. But, <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/randyslecture/">the walls are there for you to climb them</a>.
<br/>

The best way for this to happen is 1) get in touch with local researchers working in robotics &amp; control; 2) do good work with them; 3) tell them to contact us.
    Chances are we know them and will read carefully any email from them.
