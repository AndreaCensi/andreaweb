What is your favorite robot?

Fictional or non-fictional?

In the fictional category, 

WALL-E    look, it worked for an estimated 800 years with self-repairing 

R2-D2     It was the real hero of the double trilogy.


In the non-fictional, these are the three examples

Romeo and Juliet in the Ferrari factory. It doesn't get better than this. Very old school

Kiva's robots   Not the smartest robots to go around (they )

The Roomba and the Mint
