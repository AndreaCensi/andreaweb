The C(anonical) Scan Matcher (CSM) is a pure C implementation of a very fast variation of ICP 
using a point-to-line metric optimized for range-finder scan matching.

It is robust enough to be used in industrial prototypes of autonomous
mobile robotics, for example at Kuka. CSM is used by a variety of people, though it is hard to keep track because of the open source distribution, especially as packaged in ROS. 
If you use this software for something cool, let me know.

#### Download

* CSM can be download from GitHub (.zip package available) at the url:  
  [http://github.com/AndreaCensi/csm](http://github.com/AndreaCensi/csm)

* [CSM has been integrated and packaged][stack] for [ROS] by [Ivan Dryanovski][ivan].

* Oct 2013: The Github repository now contains [a new branch called ``csm_eigen``](https://github.com/AndreaCensi/csm/tree/csm_eigen). 
This branch uses the [Eigen library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) rather than [GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). This branch is the work of people working at U. Freiburg and Kuka. The main contributors are [Christoph Sprunk](http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~sprunkc/) and [Rainer Kuemmerle](http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~kuemmerl/).

#### Documentation

Please see the manual contained in the file [``csm_manual.pdf``][manual]. 

[manual]: https://github.com/AndreaCensi/csm/blob/master/csm_manual.pdf

The method is described in the paper:

[pub_ref_page id='censi08plicp']

The package also contains two methods for estimating the
uncertainty of scan matching. Those are described in the following papers: 

[pub_ref_page id='censi09posetracking']

[pub_ref_page id='censi07accurate']

[pub_ref_page id='censi07achievable']

#### Design goals

I created this package:

- To have a well-documented reference implementation of [PL-ICP](http://purl.org/censi/2007/plicp). If you are only interested in the core algorithm of PL-ICP, a [separate concise implementation in C/Matlab/Ruby](http://purl.org/censi/2007/gpc) is available.
- To have a **trustworthy** scan matcher to be used in the experiments for some papers on [ICP covariance](http://purl.org/censi/2006/icpcov), [the Cramer-Rao bound for range finders](http://purl.org/censi/2006/accuracy), and [robot calibration](http://purl.org/censi/2007/calib).  For batch experiments, it's also useful that it's pretty fast.
- To have a collection of utilies for command line (UNIX-style) manipulation of laser data,
  and creating [beautiful maps][map-example] and animations.

The package contains also a Ruby wrapper for the C library, and additional Ruby and a Matlab implementations of the same algorithm. These are not as usable or documented as the C version.

**What it is NOT**: Note that this is not a full-featured SLAM solution: this only does pairwise scan-matching between scans (but it's really good at it!).
If you are looking for a more complete SLAM solution, please see the projects listed in the [OpenSLAM](http://www.openslam.org) page; in particular you can have a look at [GMapping]. 
Many pointers to other SLAM software can be found on the pages of the Euron SLAM summer schools:
