**Abstract** -- 
Global localization is the problem of estimating the robot's pose,
without any previous information, in a world which is known.
Bayesian filters (either grid- or particle-based), need
to evaluate  the likelihood of a sensor reading given a pose hypothesis.
For a laser range finder the computation is expensive and therefore approximations
to the true likelihood that do not require a ray-tracing are usually employed.
Nevertheless, these approximations do not satisfy those that in  this paper
we identify as *orientation* and *visibility*
constraints. This paper proposes more accurate algorithms which solve, 
in part or completely, these
problems and are faster and have better complexity than existing methods.
