  \ move through the world in search of resources, they change course in reaction\
  \ to both external sensory cues and internally- generated programs. Elucidating\
  \ the functional logic of complex search algorithms is challenging because the observable\
  \ actions of the animal cannot be unambiguously assigned to externally- or internally-triggered\
  \ events. We present a technique that addresses this challenge by assessing quantitatively\
  \ the contribution of external stimuli and internal processes. We apply this technique\
  \ to the analysis of rapid turns (saccades) of freely flying Drosophila melanogaster.\
  \ We show that a single scalar feature computed from the visual stimulus experienced\
  \ by the animal is sufficient to explain a majority (93%) of the turning decisions.\
  \ We automatically estimate this scalar value from the observable trajectory, without\
  \ any assumption regarding the sensory processing. A posteriori, we show that the\
  \ estimated feature field is consistent with previous results measured in other\
  \ experimental conditions. The remaining turning decisions, not explained by this\
  \ feature of the visual input, may be attributed to a combination of deterministic\
  \ processes based on unobservable internal states and purely stochastic behavior.\
  \ We cannot distinguish these contributions using external observations alone, but\
  \ we are able to provide a quantitative bound of their relative importance with\
  \ respect to stimulus-triggered decisions. Our results suggest that comparatively\
  \ few saccades in free-flying conditions are a result of an intrinsic spontaneous\
  \ process, contrary to previous suggestions. We discuss how this technique could\
  \ be generalized for use in other systems and employed as a tool for classifying\
  \ effects into sensory, decision, and motor categories when used to analyze data\
  \ from genetic behavioral screens.\",\n    number = \"CaltechAUTHORS:20120805-120309438\"\

  \ = \"Mobile robotic mapping is now considered to be a sufficiently mature field\
  \ with demonstrated successes in various domains. While much progress has been made\
  \ in the development of computationally efficient and consistent mapping schemes,\
  \ it is still murky, at best, on how these maps can be evaluated. We are motivated\
  \ by the absence of an accepted standard for quantitatively measuring the performance\
  \ of robotic mapping systems against user-defined requirements. It is our belief\
  \ that the development of standardized methods for quantitatively evaluating existing\
  \ robotic technologies will improve the utility of mobile robots in already established\
  \ application areas, such as vacuum cleaning, robot surveillance, and bomb disposal.\
  \ This approach will also enable the proliferation and acceptance of such technologies\
  \ in emerging markets. This chapter summarizes our preliminary efforts by bringing\
  \ together the research community towards addressing this important problem which\
  \ has ramifications not only from researchers' perspective but also from consumers',\
  \ robot manufacturers', and developers' viewpoints.\",\n    note = \"10.1007/978-1-4419-0492-8_10\"\
