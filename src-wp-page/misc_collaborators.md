If I sent you this link, it is because we are embarking in something together (either as collaborators or you as a student). 


If you are a student with little to no experience in research, it might be useful to read the [advice for students][advice-students] page for general research advice.




Q: Your process 
A: Everybody else doesn't know


Approach/philosophy
-------------------

* If we are writing an algorithmics paper, please see the "25 steps to an algorithmic paper". 

* It is done when it is done (and *if* it is ever done). Life is too short to write rushed papers. Especially, life is too short to write sloppy papers. Better to write a very readable paper with fewer results.

* On the other hand,  *le mieux est l'ennemi du bien*. I was a perfectionist once.

* If you are a student: you should understand that the standards for writing a scientific paper which is reviewed by a (potentially ostile) referee are much, much, much higher than anything else you might have produced.


Best practices
--------------------------

- [Reproducible research][rr]
- [Test driven development][test]
- [Open source code][test] I develop in the open. Often times people saw me doing something that interested them randomly.


Writing
--------

I use [LyX][lyx] for everything, and you should too.
I'm OK with raw LaTeX. 

I will never under any circumstance willingly write a paper in Microsoft Word (exception granted if you are a biologist). 

On writing LaTeX:
- Do make extensive use of ``\\newcommand`` to define semantically valid construct. We will change the notation often. 

- See [this list of the symbols I use most often.][list-symbols]

Tools
-----------

In short: there is no time to be inefficient.

## OS ##

I develop on OS X but all the tools I use run on Ubuntu.
  

## Choice of programming languages ##

If you are a student: we will be using mostly Python with some C/C++ thrown there, probably as an external program. 

If you are not, you need to have a compelling reason not to use Python as the main language. My opinions on the matter are summarized as follows:

- Using C/C++ is premature optimization. Are you really telling me that you are willing to pay a 10x penalty in development time, to obtain a 10x-50x factor in your benchmark running times? *And* that will make a difference in proving your scientific thesis?

- Using Matlab is premature lobotomy of your ideas. (exception: simulations using Simulink or similar package that has no alternative outside of Matlab)

(I do not have a working knowledge of languages that I wish to learn, like OCaml and Haskell. Feel free to propose those, as long that you know you will be doing )

## Sharing data ##

If you are a student: we will be using Git. Please do the following:

- Create an account on github. 
- Make sure you can commit without entering a passowrd (otherwise you will not use it often).
- 
- See the book ...


If you are not a student: I'm ok in using subversion. We can do the Dropbox thing also.
