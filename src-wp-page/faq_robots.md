Fictional or non-fictional?

In the fictional category, I would put:

[WALL-E][walle]
: It worked for an estimated 800 years while self-repairing... enough said.

[R2-D2][r2d2]
: It was the real hero of the trilogy! [Here's a picture of me and a Lego R2-D2][picture] 
at [Legoland][legoland] in Billund, Denmark.

[R. Daneel Olivaw][daneel]
: He saved the galaxy a couple of times...

In the non-fictional category:

Romeo and Juliet in the Ferrari factory
: Romeo and Juliet are two manipulators in the Ferrari factory in Maranello, Italy,
which are used to build some of the smaller parts for Ferrari engines. 
See [this video][ferrari2] at around 1:30 for a glimpse. (Unfortunately
the whole documentary is not available online.) It just doesn't get better than this.

[Kiva's robots][kiva]
: Not the smartest robots to go around, but they are one of the success stories
of robotics in the last decades.

The [Roomba][roomba] and the [Mint][mint]
: The first consumer-oriented autonomous robots!
