<p>If I sent you this link, it is because we are embarking in something together (either as collaborators or you as a student).</p>

<p>If you are a student with little to no experience in research, it might be useful to read the <span>advice for students</span> page for general research advice.</p>

<p>Q: Your process A: Everybody else doesn&#8217;t know</p>

<h2 id='approachphilosophy'>Approach/philosophy</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>If we are writing an algorithmics paper, please see the &#8220;25 steps to an algorithmic paper&#8221;.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>It is done when it is done (and <em>if</em> it is ever done). Life is too short to write rushed papers. Especially, life is too short to write sloppy papers. Better to write a very readable paper with fewer results.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>On the other hand, <em>le mieux est l&#8217;ennemi du bien</em>. I was a perfectionist once.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>If you are a student: you should understand that the standards for writing a scientific paper which is reviewed by a (potentially ostile) referee are much, much, much higher than anything else you might have produced.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='best_practices'>Best practices</h2>

<ul>
<li><span>Reproducible research</span></li>

<li><span>Test driven development</span></li>

<li><span>Open source code</span> I develop in the open. Often times people saw me doing something that interested them randomly.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='writing'>Writing</h2>

<p>I use <span>LyX</span> for everything, and you should too. I&#8217;m OK with raw LaTeX.</p>

<p>I will never under any circumstance willingly write a paper in Microsoft Word (exception granted if you are a biologist).</p>

<p>On writing LaTeX: - Do make extensive use of <code>\\newcommand</code> to define semantically valid construct. We will change the notation often.</p>

<ul>
<li>See <span>this list of the symbols I use most often.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 id='tools'>Tools</h2>

<p>In short: there is no time to be inefficient.</p>

<h2 id='os'>OS</h2>

<p>I develop on OS X but all the tools I use run on Ubuntu.</p>

<h2 id='choice_of_programming_languages'>Choice of programming languages</h2>

<p>If you are a student: we will be using mostly Python with some C/C++ thrown there, probably as an external program.</p>

<p>If you are not, you need to have a compelling reason not to use Python as the main language. My opinions on the matter are summarized as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Using C/C++ is premature optimization. Are you really telling me that you are willing to pay a 10x penalty in development time, to obtain a 10x-50x factor in your benchmark running times? <em>And</em> that will make a difference in proving your scientific thesis?</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Using Matlab is premature lobotomy of your ideas. (exception: simulations using Simulink or similar package that has no alternative outside of Matlab)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>(I do not have a working knowledge of languages that I wish to learn, like OCaml and Haskell. Feel free to propose those, as long that you know you will be doing )</p>

<ul>
<li>See the book &#8230;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='sharing_data'>Sharing data</h2>

<p>If you are a student: we will be using Git. Please do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create an account on github.</li>

<li>Make sure you can commit without entering a passowrd (otherwise you will not use it often).</li>

<li>See the book &#8230;</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are not a student: I&#8217;m ok in using subversion. We can do the Dropbox thing also.</p>
