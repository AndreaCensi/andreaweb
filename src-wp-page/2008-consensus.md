**Abstract** --- This paper concerns the average consensus problem with the
constraint of quantized communication between nodes. A
broad class of algorithms is analyzed, in which the
transmission strategy, which decides what value to
communicate to the neighbors, can include various kinds of
rounding, probabilistic quantization, and bounded noise.
The arbitrariness of the transmission strategy is
compensated by a feedback mechanism which can be
interpreted as a self-inhibitory action. The result is that
the average of the nodes state is not conserved across
iterations, and the nodes do not converge to a consensus;
however, we show that both errors can be made as small as
desired. Bounds on these quantities involve the spectral
properties of the graph and can be proved by employing
elementary techniques of LTI systems analysis.
