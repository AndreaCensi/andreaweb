A.C. **Bootstrapping Vehicles: a formal approach to unsupervised sensorimotor learning based on invariance**, PhD dissertation, Caltech, 2012. 

- [Version 1.3 (PDF, 380 pages, 25MB, A4/letter format)][bv1-a4]
- [Slides from my defense][defense]

This is version 1.3 of my dissertation; I was not satisfied with the "official" 1.0 version, and I'm still adding material that I didn't have time to write. Because this is still a work in progress, any feedback is most appreciated.
