**Questions** that we investigate

- Where does the robustness of the fly behavior in spite of large sensor uncertainty comes from?
- To what degree is the behavior of the fly identifiable from external observations? In particular, we are interested in free-flying behavior. Otherwise, essentially linearized, first-order response

**Approach**

- Computation/simulaiton

**Recent work**

- Paper 1
