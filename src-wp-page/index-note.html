    There is funding available for MIT PhD/MS students

        circumstances, we do not bring in visiting students due 
        to bureaucratic complications and fees)</span>

        Come to the  <a href="http://jic.mit.edu/">Summer Meetings on Joint Inference and Control</a> during July-August. (Or attend remotely by Webex.)
