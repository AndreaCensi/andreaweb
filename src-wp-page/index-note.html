            We are organizing a workshop on <a href="http://big-questions.mit.edu">The Big Questions in Robotics" at RSS 2015</a> (Jul 16-17).
            (Yes, really, the name is "The Big Questions in Robotics". After our friends in Freiburg
             organized the workshop "Why Robotics Sucks" we figured that everything goes.)
