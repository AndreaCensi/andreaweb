        As of July 2019, I am not employed anymore with Aptiv.
        Between 2016 and 2019 I worked for nuTonomy, an MIT self-driving cars startup.
         Since 2018 I was
        Director of Research at Aptiv, the company that acquired nuTonomy.
        The division has since been spun-off as <a href="http://www.motional.com">Motional</a>.

    <li>As of January 2017, I left MIT to join ETH Zürich.</li>
