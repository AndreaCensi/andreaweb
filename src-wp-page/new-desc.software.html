<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Most of my papers come with software and datasets
in the spirit of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata">reproducible research</a>
(subject to time constraints...).</p>

<p>Some <strong>general-purpose software</strong> that came out as a side-effect of my research are</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://andreacensi.github.io/contracts/">PyContracts</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://compmake.org">Compmake</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Some robotics-specific software package: </p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://purl.org/censi/2007/csm">CSM scan matcher</A>.
This is currently maintained by Kuka. It is integrated in many ROS packages.

</ul>

<p class='for for-sw-users'>Software users: It's always great to know that my software is used for something interesting. Please send me an email if you do.
Regretfully, lately I don't really have the time to help with making things work. </p>
