<h2>Software</h2>

<p>Most of my papers come with software and datasets
in the spirit of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata">reproducible research</a>
(subject to time constraints...). These are the software packages that were polished
and documented enough for wider use.</p>


<p class='for for-sw-users'>Software users: It's always great to know that my software is used for something cool. Please send me an email if you do.</p>

<p>Some <strong>general-purpose software</strong> that came out as a side-effect of my research:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://andreacensi.github.io/contracts/">PyContracts</a>
is a Python package that allows to declare constraints on function parameters and return values. It supports a basic type system, variables binding, arithmetic constraints, and has several specialized contracts (notably for Numpy arrays). As a quick intro, 
please see <a href="http://censi.mit.edu/pub/research/201410-pycontracts/201410-pycontracts.pdf">this presentation about PyContracts</a>.

  </li>
  <li><a href="http://compmake.org">Compmake</a>
is a Python library that provides “Make”–like facilities to a Python application, including
job management and parallelization (multiple CPU on a single host, cluster computing using SGE, and experimental support for cloud computing using Multyvac).

<p>Some <strong>robotics-specific</strong> software packages: </p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://purl.org/censi/2007/csm">CSM scan matcher</A>.
This is currently maintained by Kuka. It is integrated in many ROS packages.<br/>
