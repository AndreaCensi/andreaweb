If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!

All that is gold does not glitter,
<span class='high'>Not all those who wander are lost</span>;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
<!-- From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.[1]

<span class='hide'>I was the better at getting and keeping,
   You were the better at spend and spend;
I was the better at grubbing and heaping,
   But who was the better man in the end?
Yes, who was the better man, my friend?
      Who was the better man?

</span>You were the better with lords and ladies,
   I was the better at pillaging Troy;
You were the better at kissing the babies,
   I was the better at search and destroy.
<span>But who was the better man, old boy?
   Who was the better man?</span><span class='hide'>
I was the better at improvisation,
   You were the better at spinning the plate;
I was the better at procrastination,
   You were the better at quiet debate.
But who was the better man, old mate?
   Who was the better man?

You were the better at rolling a reefer,
   I was the better with coke and rum;
Remember that night on the beach at Ibiza?
   The Maori twins with the tattooed bum?
So who was the better man, old chum?
   Who was the better man?

    ***

Now we come down to it, relatives grieving
   Out in the hall with their crocodile tears;
Now that you’re out of it, now that you’re leaving,
   Now that they’ve sealed your arse and your ears,
What I’ve been meaning to tell you for years,
   And years, and years, and years, old friend...
Is that you were the better man, in the end;
   You were the better man,
      My friend.
