Hi folks,

Somebody had asked me a reference about writing math. 

These are the notes from a class by Knuth on how to write mathematics, which covers the basics. (Knuth created TeX plus wrote the immense The Art of Computer Programming)

Here's some general advice on writing.

In my experience people write bad papers because:
1) The average paper that they read is badly written -- don't try to imitate the average, you will end up mediocre.
2) People don't understand that filling 8 pages of text is only the first step towards writing the paper, and they ignore the editing stage. It takes lots of sweat to write something that is easy to read.

If a paper is badly written, the message that gets to the reader is that the author doesn't care much about that paper, and therefore it can be probably ignored. Simplest example: if a paper is written in Word, it means that the author doesn't care much about the math => probably nothing interesting to learn. 

Apart from that, in my experience, 95% of paper rejections at the conference level are because the paper is not clear, not because the contribution is not significant enough. 

General advice: practice, tools, and feedback.

- Practice practice practice. It's worth writing papers on simple work that you do, so that when you have your big contribution to send into the world you will know how to communicate it.

- Tools are important and you should spend time learning them. 
 For example, you should use LyX or any other graphical interface to TeX: it will make you immensely more productive especially at the editing stage.  You should also learn TeX and packages for doing fancy things (but careful, it might become a time sink).

- Feedback: Accept that at the beginning your papers will suck. Find somebody who will tell you exactly why they suck. Also accept that any criticism is implicitly an assertion that you could do better, so it's really a compliment in disguise.


cheers,
A.
