        Modeling robot motion planning with uncertainty in a
        Bayesian framework leads to a computationally intractable
        stochastic control problem. We seek hypotheses that can
        justify a separate implementation of control, localization
        and planning. In the end, we reduce the stochastic control
        problem to path-planning in the extended space of poses x
        covariances; the transitions between states are modeled
        through the use of the Fisher information matrix. In this
        framework, we consider two problems: minimizing the
        execution time, and minimizing the final covariance, with
        an upper bound on the execution time. Two correct and
        complete algorithms are presented. The first is the direct
        extension of classical graph-search algorithms in the
        extended space. The second one is a back-projection
        algorithm: uncertainty constraints are propagated backward
        from the goal towards the start state.

 An ICP variant using a point-to-line metric.

        This paper describes PLICP, an  ICP (Iterative
        Closest/Corresponding Point) variant that uses a
        point-to-line metric, and an exact closed-form for
        minimizing such metric. The resulting algorithm has some
        interesting properties: it converges quadratically, and in
        a finite number of steps. The method is validated against
        vanilla ICP, IDC (Iterative Dual Correspondences), and
        MbICP (Metric-Based ICP) by reproducing the experiments
        performed in Minguez et al. (2006). The experiments suggest
        that PLICP is more precise, and requires less iterations.
        However, it is less robust to very large initial
        displacement errors. The last part of the paper is devoted
        to purely algorithmic optimization of the correspondence
        search; this allows for significant speed-up of the
        computation. The source code is available for download.

 Lazy localization using the Frozen-Time Smoother.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

        We present a new algorithm for solving the global localization
        problem called Frozen-Time Smoother (FTS). Time is `frozen', in
        the sense that the belief always refers to the same time instant,
        instead of following a moving target, like Monte Carlo
        Localization does. This algorithm works in the case in which
        global localization is formulated as a smoothing problem, and a
        precise estimate of the incremental motion of the robot is
        usually available. These assumptions correspond to the case when
        global localization is used to solve the loop closing problem in
        SLAM. We compare FTS to two Monte Carlo methods designed with the
        same assumptions. The experiments suggest that a naive
        implementation of the FTS is more efficient than an extremely
        optimized equivalent Monte Carlo solution. Moreover, the FTS has
        an intrinsic laziness: it does not need frequent updates (scans
        can be integrated once every many meters) and it can process data
        in arbitrary order. The source code and datasets are available
        for download.

 Simultaneous maximum-likelihood calibration of robot and sensor

<blockquote><font size="-1">

        For a differential-drive mobile robot equipped with an
        on-board range sensor, there are six parameters to
        calibrate: three for the odometry (radii and distance
        between the wheels), and three for the pose of the sensor
        with respect to the robot frame. This paper describes a
        method for calibrating all six parameters at the same time,
        without the need for external sensors or devices. Moreover,
        it is not necessary to drive the robot along particular
        trajectories. The available data are the measures of the
        angular velocities of the wheels and the range sensor
        readings. The maximum-likelihood calibration solution is
        found in a closed form.

<blockquote><font size="-1">

 Existing methods for estimating the covariance of the ICP 
 (Iterative Closest/Corresponding Point) algorithm are either 
 inaccurate or are computationally too expensive to be used online. 
 This paper proposes a new method, based on the analysis of the error
 function being minimized. It considers that the correspondences are 
 not independent (the same measurement being used in more than one correspondence),
 and explicitly utilizes the covariance matrix of the measurements, 
 which are not assumed to be independent either. The validity of the
 approach is verified through extensive simulations: it is more accurate 
than previous methods and its computational load is negligible. 
The ill-posedness of the surface matching problem is explicitly tackled 
for under-constrained situations by performing an observability analysis; 
in the analyzed cases the method still provides a good estimate of the
 error projected on the observable manifold.

 On achievable accuracy for range-finder localization.

    The covariance of every unbiased estimator is bounded by the Cramer-Rao
    lower bound, which is the inverse of Fisher's information matrix.
    This paper shows that, for the case of localization with range-finders,
    Fisher's matrix is a function of the expected readings and of the
    orientation of the environment's surfaces at the sensed points. The
    matrix also offers a mathematically sound way to characterize under-
    constrained situations as those for which it is singular: in those
    cases the kernel describes the direction of maximum uncertainty.
    This paper also introduces a simple model of unstructured environments
    for which the Cramer-Rao bound is a function of two statistics of
    the shape of the environment: the average radius and a measure of
    the irregularity of the surfaces. Although this model is not valid
    for all environments, it allows for some interesting qualitative
    considerations. As an experimental validation, this paper reports
    simulations comparing the bound with the actual performance of the
    ICP (Iterative Closest/Corresponding Point) algorithm. Finally, it
    is discussed the difficulty in extending these results to find a
    lower bound for accuracy in scan matching and SLAM.
