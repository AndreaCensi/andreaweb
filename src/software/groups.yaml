    This is software which is attached to one of my papers.
    I always released all non-trivial software: I think this should be compulsory
    for every scientific publication (not necessarily with an open-source license.)
    With each paper, I'm trying to make my software more compatible with the principles of
    [reproducible research][rr] ("one click" to run the experiments and produce the figures)
    but I'm not there yet.
