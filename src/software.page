*[Software related to my research](research/sw/index.html) is elsewhere.*

I like to shuffle bits around.This is what is currently publicly available as well-packaged software:

- [Maruku], a free (GPL) [Markdown] interpreter written in Ruby.

- **(frozen)** [K6][k6], a free (GPL) KDE client for [C6][c6]. 
  
  - [Reverse engineering of the C6 protocol][proto].
