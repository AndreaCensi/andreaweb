	<p>This is the land of video games, but you 
	might be surprised at the kinds of games
	that fill the 8-story entertainment buildings.</p>
	
	<p>
	<em>Pachinko</em> is the Japanese pinball/slot machine and can be a hobby, a passion, 
	an obsession or even a job:
	it seems that it is not entirely a matter of luck and there are people 
	that actually make a living with it. 
	The foreigner wanting to learn how to play is promptly 
	rejected out of the doors by the unbearable noise of thousands of
	steel balls bouncing around.

	There are floors and floors of Ufo Catcher games: 100&yen; and
	you can try to grab very <em>kawai</em> things.

	Let's turn to more traditional video games and let's see what's trendy here
	and will be probably imported in the future in our countries.

	They found a way to mix the collectible cards trading games a la <em>Magic</em>
	with strategy videogames. So here people buy these cards and then play with them
	against the machine.

<p>
	There also multi-player games. In this one, people sit quietly watching
	a horse race. On their own screen they can place bets
	and pat the favourite horse.

	The trendiest are music-simulation game.
	There's usually a set of three: the keyboards, the guitar and the drums
	which can be played alone or by a group of three persons.
	A simplified music score scrolls in front of you and you have to play
	the keys/drums/strings with the right tempo.
	The professional gamers have a "fidelity" card on which their performance is recorded.

	The strange thing is that there are not beginners of any game and I always
	see expert players. There's a girl that I see every time I go there - she is
	always playing the same guitar game, with the same song. It seems to me
	that the Japanese put an enormous amount of effort in every activity, and
	games are no exception.

	<p>
	In my effort to blend in the country, I thought I had
	to become proficient in at least one of these games.
	I tried the keyboards, but several years of piano lessons proved worthless.
	I tried the drums, but rhythm isn't my thing.
	Finally I found my own quest - actually, it's more of an addiction now -
	with Namco Taiko Drum Master, which is a dumbed-down version of the
	drums game.
	A <em>taiko</em> is a traditional Japanese drum. Here's the big one at Meiji Shingu:

	The game is easy: you see red and blue circles on the screen.
	Red circle: bang in the middle, blue circle: bang on the side.

It's addictive; unfortunately I couldn't find the PAL version
of the PlayStation game which comes with a <em>sugoi</em> drum controller.
</p>

<p>Last week I reached the apex of my taiko drummer career, when
I finally got a <em>high score</em> on the machine. Just after I wrote
my name in hiragana (a-n-do-re-a), a <em>ninninsei</em> - a black-uniform dressed
12 years old kid - who was watching me, started a game, chose
the same songs as I did, but in the next difficulty level and
got a perfect score. So much for my moment of glory.
