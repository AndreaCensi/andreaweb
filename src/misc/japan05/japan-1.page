Dear all,
  
<p>A lot of people will receive this, and to some of you it might be a
unsolicited mail: it will hopefully make a vaguely interesting read. I
have to use English (that, in my opinion, is a sort of barbarian
language - they were able <a href="http://www.spellingsociety.org/news/media/poems.php">to 
screw up the whole phonetic system</a>)
because the audience is quite international.
</p>

<p>
  I'm writing from a small room in a two-storey edifice at the periphery
  of Tokyo. As you know, I'm not a tourist here, as I will stay as a
  visitor for 3 months at the <a
  href="http://www-robot.mes.titech.ac.jp/home_e.html">Hirose-Yoneda
  laboratory</a> at <a href="http://www.titech.ac.jp/">Tokyo Institute of
  Technology</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I arrived here three days ago. It's my third time to Japan: every time
  the first days are similar to a strange dream (sometimes, a nightmarish
  dream). I get projected in this strange alien world where I don't
  understand the writings, or what people tell me, or more generally what
  is going on around me because I haven't slept properly for days and I
  begin to think that maybe a considerable number of my neurons didn't
  get through passport control.
</p>
<p>
  For example, yesterday I was awake at 3 AM. As I could not fall asleep
  again, at 6 I went out to Shibuya, one of the busiest places in Tokyo.
  Instead of about 35 min., it took me over two hours to get there
  because of multiple errors in the choice of tracks - you really need
  all your neurons to use the Tokyo transportation system (compare <a
  href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/censi/55167833/">this map</a> with
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/censi/55162492/">this one</a>).
  Anyway, at 8:45 I was at Shibuya, only to discover that practically
  everything was closed and would not open until 10:00. Fortunately,
  Starbucks was open and I could get myself something resembling an
  espresso.
</p>
<p>
  That espresso helped me to make the only productive thing of the day:
  buying a digital camera (that's a common clich&eacute; for tourists
  here).</p>

 <p>
  So, I can now show you the first thing that you see entering my house.

<p>
  Yes, here we have some friendly pets of various species. I was about
  to leave the place, but people say that it's not uncommon in Tokyo
  houses.
</p>
<p>
  And here's my room.
</p>
  
  <div class="frame"><a class="photo" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/censi/54757247/"><img
  moz-do-not-send="true" alt="My room"

  </div>

<p>
  I went to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harajuku">Harajuku</a>
  today, a place where teens go to dress up and show themselves to a
  crowd of photographers.

  <p>
	The costumes are inspired by manga (comics), anime (cartoons), video
  games, or simply by fashion; the themes change periodically, for
  example, I could not spot nothing similar to those from <a
  href="http://www.photosaga.com/Japon%20kids/index.htm">this
  gallery</a>, except, of course, for the eternal classic of the <a
  href="http://images.google.com/images?q=gothic%20lolita">gothic
  lolita</a>.
</p>
<p>
  These two are characters from the "Final fantasy" video game.

<p>
  And this is an example of the "decorator" style.

<p>
  Enough for today. You can use <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a>
  to reach me: my user-id is "censia". Keep in mind the time difference
  of +8hours (when it's 8:00 in Europe, it's 16:00 in Japan), and that I
  often leave my computer unattended.
