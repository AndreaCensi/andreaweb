	<p>Let me introduce the people 
	living in my apartment.</p>
	
	
	<p>
	  Hugo is French. He was born in Toulouse and studied computer science
	  in Paris.
	  Two years ago he met his Japanese girlfriend. 
	  The power of love gave him the dedication to learn 800 kanji in two years.
	  There are special agreements between France and Japan, so he can stay with
	  a "vacance-travaille" visa for one year, working as a waiter.
	  Now I think that I'm learning more French than Japanese here.
	 </p>

	<p>
	  Kim-san is Korean. He's a computer programmer for Hitachi.
	  We make very long conversations. The problem is that,
	  usually, Kim-san talks in Japanese with Hugo who then translates for me,
	  and it seems that going from Japanese to French/English there's a very 
	  high compression ratio: minutes of conversation are condensed
	  in a single sentence by Hugo. Lost in translation? it actually happens.

	  <p>
	  He is very lucky to have French and Italian consultants to help
	  him match his ties and shirts.

	 <p>Kahn-san is Kim-san's room-mate. He worked for Samsung in Korea 
	 (have you ever wondered who writes the software for your cell phone?).

	 </div>
	 <p>
	 I'm learning a lot about Korea. For example, I discovered that the 
	 Korean writing system (called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangul">Hangul</a>)
	 is one of the best engineered
	 systems in the world. It's phonetic (one symbol-one sound, like
	 Italian and Spanish, and unlike English, French, etc..) and syllabes
	 are represented graphically.
	 
	</p>
	<p>
	  Other people: 
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
		 Jay from California is (you guessed it) a computer programmer.
		 He came here to improve his Japanese; after two years
		 he has not done much progress and his advice to
		 beginners is: just don't try. 
	  </li>
	  <li>
		 Xiao-san - read as "choo-san" - is a Chinese girl.
		 (I once found myself in an elevator with three girls named:
		 <a href="http://coa.inducks.org/character.php/5/AMJ">cho, chu, and cha</a>.)
		 She doesn't speak English at all so I don't know much about her.
	  </li>
	  <li>
		Then there's a black guy, name unknown, that I met only two times so far,
		and both times it was at night while he exited semi-naked from the bathroom.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>Yesterday we made a pasta-<em>paati</em>. I ran the show and sent them
	to buy the ingredients for carbonara (among them, &#12506;&#12467;&#12522;&#12494; - pecorino). It was 
	really an adventure to cook carbonara with ham instead of bacon,
	 anemic "fettuccine", strange coloured eggs and really suspicious cheese.

	<p>
	Here, carbonara meets "kimchi", a Korean dish: this encounter is just very wrong.

	It wasn't so bad after all, but I really had a culture choc when
	they started to eat the Japanese way: bowl in the hand and lot of slurping.
