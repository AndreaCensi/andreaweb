  Of course it is possible to find "normal" western food here. The
  grocery seems a jewellery shop, both for presentation and prices.
  Usually each fruit is sold separately within a nice package. I am not
  to translate the prices, as you wouldn't believe it anyway.

  <p>         And this is an example of the unusual fruit and vegetables you can
  find here:

  I must admit that every day I indulge myself in luxury. I go to a small
  shop with an English name and a 19th century look.
  As I enter, I am greeted by a smell of cotton candy and the voices of
  four employees dressed as white and green elves - <em>irasshaimase</em>! I take
  a tray and wander through the shelves. I see a hundred of specialties
  that I can taste while I hear the carillon version of Disney's
  Pinocchio theme. I put my chosen piece over the tray and go back to the
  cashier. A green elf wears up some gloves and cuts the piece in halves
  with chirurgical precision. She wraps it in plastic, closing it with a
  golden ribbon and putting all in a bigger bag. While she offers it to
  me she sings a 10 second tune (which, to the untrained ear, is
  something like <em>la la la la la la la arigato gosaimasta!</em>) meaning:
  thank you. This is the procedure for buying 200g of bread which
  should be about 11&euro;/Kg.

  Japanese food can be cheap. It is possible to eat a complete meal for
  under 1000&yen; (7&euro;). The first time it is quite funny to see the
  food reproductions outside the restaurants. Then one realizes
  they serve for a nice "point &amp; eat" interface for people
  that spent the last four years studying engineering instead of Japanese.
  Then the cost of the meal is exactly the one shown, as there are no
  taxes, service or tip. Service is excellent also in the gloomiest
  of eateries.

  Here's a fake tempura (rice topped with fried shrimps and vegetables)
  and the real thing:

  There's a neighborhood in Tokyo called Asakusa where there are
  specialized shops for fake food.

  In this part of the city, away from the lights, there are
  beautiful temples, traditional markets, some geishas and a lot
  of theatres.

  Back in Italy I read "Asakusa Kid", by  
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi_Kitano">Takeshi Kitano</a> 
  (comedian and film director - you might have seen "Dolls" or "Zatoichi".
  The original name of the italian TV program "Mai dire banzai" was 
  "Takeshi's castle"); in the book he describes the first stages of his career
  as an actor in the Asakusa theatres, before his rising to fame, and his
  life in the neighborhood. A lot has changed in 30 years but still
  I had some deja vu.

  I managed to snap a photo of an actor (the one with the blue kimono) 
  taking compliments after the performance.

  Okay, maybe it's a little out of focus - I need practice with the new camera.
