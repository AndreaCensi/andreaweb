 My Japanese is (very) slowly progressing. I'm ditching my current
 study book "Japanese for busy people" because I got bored 
 of Mr. Smith's (that is, <em>Su-mi-su-san</em>) and Mr. Brown's (<em>Bu-ra-u-n-san</em>)
 business trips and meetings. The most exciting story
 was chapter 7 when they take a break and go to a Sumo match.
 I was excited to read about some real action, but then I
 peeked at the end of the book just to find a uninteresting story
 in which they walk together to the public library. Will Mr.Smith be able
 to get a membership card? This suspense is not solved in
 the last chapter, when Mr. Smith writes a boring letter to his sensei.

 I then felt ready for some real material. I went to Akihabara (the electric city)
 and bought an electronic dictionary.

 which, alas, was not that cheap but necessary nevertheless.

 Then I headed to  one of the omnipresent comics stores to get some 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga">manga</a>.
 It turns out that there are various genres. Firstly, I can't read kanji yet,
 so I needed to get manga for children, say less than 13 years old,
 because there's the phonetic transcription 
 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana">furigana</a>).
 These are roughly divided in those for girls and those for boys.
 I skimmed through some of the girlie ones and found way too much sugar for me.
 Moreover I know that it's hard to understand children, it's hard to understand
 the Japanese people, it's hard to understand the language
 and everybody knows it's hard to understand girls, therefore it would
 prove an impossible task to understand Japanese-written psychological stories of
 12 years old J-girls. 
 </p>
 
 <p>
 In the boys section I found lots of adventure manga; some of them
 you surely know (again, if you have a decent age) are: 
 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball">Dragon Ball</a>, 
 Yu-gi-ho, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokuto_No_Ken">Hokuto no Ken</a> etc.
 I had to discard those because there's not much dialog and I'm sure 
 I won't find any occasion to yell "Ah! I did a delayed hit on your secret pressure point! 
 Now you only have seven seconds to live!". 
 In the end, I opted for 
 Japanese-written psichological stories of 12 years old J-<em>boys</em>.

I think that "<a href="http://www.tokyopop.com/dbpage.php?propertycode=GGG&categorycode=BMG"
>Boys Be</a>" is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engrish">engrish</a>
for "being boys". 
It seems that these have the same lives of italian boys, but they're far more repressed
and baffled by their female pals with the 
never-praised-enough
short skirts.
I like the mix of drama and comedy, as in this canonical example.
This guy and this girl are "special" friends; that is, the walk around 
holding their hands, always with red faces.

<p>One day, he meets another girl - or to use the correct technical jargon,
"the blonde bitch" - who also has actual breasts (as we can see, breasts that talk!).

<p>He is seduced by her, but he is not up to the situation, so he panics and runs away.

<p>I consider the next scene a gem. The girl sees some lipstick on the guy's mouth and
she handles him a hand-kerchief. Then she asks (my translation) "was she more beautiful
than me?". He is embarassed, he rubs harder (<em>go-shi go-shi go-shi go-shi</em>) 
and then astonishes her with the 
answer: "yes". <em>Note: manga are drawn right-to-left.</em>

<p>
I just asked the people here to confirm my translation. I got it very wrong. She says:
"you should clean yourself better" and not "was she more beautiful than me?".
(anyway I think that in my version there was more drama)
