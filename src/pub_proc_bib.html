 Existing methods for estimating the covariance of the ICP 
 (Iterative Closest/Corresponding Point) algorithm are either 
 inaccurate or are computationally too expensive to be used online. 
 This paper proposes a new method, based on the analysis of the error
 function being minimized. It considers that the correspondences are 
 not independent (the same measurement being used in more than one correspondence),
 and explicitly utilizes the covariance matrix of the measurements, 
 which are not assumed to be independent either. The validity of the
 approach is verified through extensive simulations: it is more accurate 
than previous methods and its computational load is negligible. 
The ill-posedness of the surface matching problem is explicitly tackled 
for under-constrained situations by performing an observability analysis; 
in the analyzed cases the method still provides a good estimate of the
 error projected on the observable manifold.

	The covariance of every unbiased estimator is bounded by the Cramer-Rao
	lower bound, which is the inverse of Fisher's information matrix.
	This paper shows that, for the case of localization with range-finders,
	Fisher's matrix is a function of the expected readings and of the
	orientation of the environment's surfaces at the sensed points. The
	matrix also offers a mathematically sound way to characterize under-
	constrained situations as those for which it is singular: in those
	cases the kernel describes the direction of maximum uncertainty.
	This paper also introduces a simple model of unstructured environments
	for which the Cramer-Rao bound is a function of two statistics of
	the shape of the environment: the average radius and a measure of
	the irregularity of the surfaces. Although this model is not valid
	for all environments, it allows for some interesting qualitative
	considerations. As an experimental validation, this paper reports
	simulations comparing the bound with the actual performance of the
	ICP (Iterative Closest/Corresponding Point) algorithm. Finally, it
	is discussed the difficulty in extending these results to find a
	lower bound for accuracy in scan matching and SLAM.}
