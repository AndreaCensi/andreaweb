<!--[My background](background.html); -->

Current research:

* My Master's thesis (supervisors: [De Luca], [Oriolo]) is about 
  motion-planning with uncertainty constraints.
* I'm studying communication for rational agents. Up to now, this has been
  fun blue-sky research. Applications should be in the context of coordination 
  for multi-agent systems (with [Sandrof][]).

* [An accurate closed-form estimate of ICP's covariance][icpcov] (**ICRA'07**)

* [On achievable accuracy for range finder localization][aarl]   (**ICRA'07**)

* [A comparison of algorithms for likelihood approximation in Bayesian localization][ghtv] 


* **Scan matching**


  I researched the problem of 2D <em>scan matching</em>,
  that is obtaining an incremental estimate <span class="math">(dx,dy,d&theta;)</span> of 
  the robot's movements 
  by comparing and integrating the interoceptive sensors with exteroceptive range sensors; scan
  matching eliminates part of the noise and most of the bias contained in the odometry
  estimate.
  Several SLAM methods have scan matching at their core;
  these methods have been very popular recently because
  advancements in laser sensor devices permitted to obtain good scan matchers.

  I elaborated two algorithms:

  - [HSM][HSM], which aims at global, complete searches. (ICRA'05)

  - [GPM][GPM], which tries to make the most of the odometry model. (ICRA'06)
