**Abstract** --- This paper presents Cramer--Rao bound-like inequalities for
pose tracking, which is defined as the problem of
recovering the robot displacement given two successive
readings of a relative sensor. The experimental
verification is done for the particular case of 2D
scan-matching (pose tracking using range-finders).
