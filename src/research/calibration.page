**Abstract** --  For a differential-drive mobile robot equipped with an on-board range sensor, there are six parameters to calibrate: three for the odometry
(radii and distance between the wheels), and three for the pose of
the sensor with respect to the robot frame.  
This paper describes a method for calibrating all six parameters at
the same time, with no need of external sensors or apparatuses, and
no need to drive the robot along particular trajectories. We assume
that the available data are: the measured axes velocities, and the
range sensor measurements. The maximum-likelihood solution is found
in closed form.
