I'm mainly interested in **robotics**, and, in particular, in all things related to handling uncertainty (localization, estimation, planning, communication). I like simple algorithms with solid mathematical properties. I like the measurements space.

Recently, I have taken an interest in bio-plausible/bio-inspired control.

No, I don't have a thesis topic yet. Suggestions are welcome.

<!--
I try to keep only a handful of things in mind at a given time. At this very moment (Fall 2008), I'm focusing more on:
- Algebraic properties of planning in information spaces.
- Bayesian bounds for pose-tracking, SLAM; Gaussian processes.
- Value of information in multi-agent systems.

Also, this term I will be taking courses in neuroscience / neuromorphic computing.
