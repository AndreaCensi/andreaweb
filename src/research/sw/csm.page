**What is this.** 


I created this package:

- To have a well-documented reference implementation of [PL-ICP](http://purl.org/censi/2007/plicp). If you are only interested in the core algorithm of PL-ICP, a [separate concise implementation in C/Matlab/Ruby](http://purl.org/censi/2007/gpc) is available.

- To have a **trustworthy** scan matcher to be used in the experiments for some papers on [ICP covariance](http://purl.org/censi/2006/icpcov), [the Cramer-Rao bound for range finders](http://purl.org/censi/2006/accuracy), and [robot calibration](http://purl.org/censi/2007/calib).  For batch experiments, it's also useful that it's pretty fast.

- To have a collection of utilies for command line (UNIX-style) manipulation of laser data,
  and creating [beautiful maps][map-example] and animations.

In the package, there is also some other software: a Ruby wrapper for the C library, a Ruby and a Matlab implementation of the same algorithm. These are not usable as of now. Then, it's also my repository for miscellaneous useful scripts.

**What it is NOT**: Note that this is not a full-featured SLAM solution: this only does pairwise scan-matching between scans -- but it's really good at it! 

If you are looking for a more complete SLAM solution, please see the projects listed in the [OpenSLAM](http://www.openslam.org) page; in particular you can have a look at [GMapping]. 

Many pointers to other SLAM software can be found on the pages of the Euron SLAM summer schools: 
[2002 (Stockholm)](http://www.cas.kth.se/SLAM/),
[2004 (Toulouse)](http://www.laas.fr/SLAM/),
[2006 (Oxford)](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~SSS06/Website/index.html).
Other related projects are [Carmen] and [Stage].

### Download ###

This is a stable snapshot as of September 2007:

<http://purl.org/censi/research/csm/csm-20070915.zip>

**2008-09-10: there is a severe bug in that version; please use repository**

You can access the current version on a Subversion repository:

	$ svn checkout https://svn.cds.caltech.edu/subversion/andrea/csm

Use the username "guest" / password "guest". This gives you read-only access. Mail me if you need write access.

<!--Download the experiments (warning, big files) with:

	$ svn checkout svn://net143-184.mclink.it/csm/experiments

Download both with:

	$ svn checkout svn://net143-184.mclink.it/csm

You should ask Andrea for a username/password if you don't have one.

### Documentation / getting started ###

Please see the manual contained in the package.
