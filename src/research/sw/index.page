*[Software **not** related to research](../../software.html) is elsewhere.*

Most of [my papers](../index.html) come with software attached.
Software strictly related to a particular paper is in that paper's page.
On this page, instead, there is a list of re-usable / independent packages.

Packages:

* [The C(anonical) scan matcher](csm.html), used in many of my papers.

* [OpenRDK] is the robotics framework developed at the [SIED] lab.

Bits and pieces:

* [Solving the generalized 2d point-correspondence problem](gpc.html):
  the core function of [PL-ICP](http://purl.org/censi/2007/plicp).

* [The eigen-decomposition of a 2x2 matrix](2x2_eigen.html): more difficult than it seems!


<!-- * [Calibration](http://purl.org/censi/2007/calibration)
* [Planning with uncertainty](http://purl.org/censi/2007/ppu)
* [Global (re)localization](http://purl.org/censi/2007/ftf)
* [Hough Scan Matching](http://purl.org/censi/2006/hsm) -->
