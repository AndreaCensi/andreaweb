**Abstract** -- We consider the problem of attitude stabilization using
exclusively visual sensory input, and we look for a
solution which can satisfy the constraints of a
“bio-plausible” computation. We obtain a PD controller
which is a bilinear form of the goal image, and the current
and delayed visual input. Moreover, this controller can be
learned using classic neural networks algorithms. The
structure of the resulting computation, derived from
general principles by imposing a bilinear computation, has
striking resemblances with existing models for visual
information processing in insects (Reichardt Correlators
and lobula plate tangential cells). We validate the
algorithms using faithful simulations of the fruit fly
visual input.
