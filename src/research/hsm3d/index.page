**Abstract** -- This paper presents HSM3D, an algorithm for global rigid
6DOF alignment of 3D point clouds. The algorithm works by
projecting the two input sets into the Radon/Hough domain,
whose properties allow to decompose the 6DOF search into a
series of fast one-dimensional cross-correlations. No
planes or other particular features must be present in the
input data, and the algorithm is provably complete in the
case of noise-free input. The algorithm has been
experimentally validated on publicly available data sets.
