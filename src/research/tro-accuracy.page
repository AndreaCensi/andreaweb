**Abstract** -- This paper investigates the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) and the Cram√©r--Rao bound (CRB) for localization with range-finders. The FIM depends on the geometry of the environment and the sensor model; it can be used for both quantitative and qualitative analysis of localization (for example, to detect under-constrained situations). The CRB is shown to be approximately strict by analyzing the performance of the ICP (Iterative Closest/Corresponding Point) algorithm, suitably modified to behave like the maximum-likelihood estimator. According to the principles of [reproducible research], data sets and source code are included in the supplementary online material.
