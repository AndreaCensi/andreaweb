  Living in Japan is about following rules. (For comparison, living in
  Italy is about working around the rules). Today's rule is Garbage
  Disposal. In the households, one must distinguish among: "burnable",
  "non-burnable" (plastic), "resources" (PET/glass/paper).

  Even at Mc Donald's:

  The big companies with a zero-emission policy have up to 15 kinds of
  garbage:

  It is not uncommon for your neighbours to open your garbage bag to
  check that you do it right. If not, your garbage will not get picked
  up, they will knock at your door or directly call your landlord.
  Therefore you must do this properly.
</p>
<p>
  Seems like a well-thought and ordered system, doesn't it? But coming
  from abroad I can't help seeing the inconsistencies and having those
  hey-the-king-is-naked perceptions.
</p>
<p>
  Garbage collection happens only once or twice per week: (note the
  sentence: <em>please be aware that your manner of disposing of
  household garbage is one of the most important issues in the
  neighbourhood</em>)

  During the week trash must be kept inside the house:

<p>
The night before the established day, residents put the bags outside.
There aren't garbage bins - trash bags stay for a night outside before
collection. In my neighbourhood roads are large and well kept, but houses
don't seem well built; most of them are wooden. It is obvious that in
these conditions there are problems with rats and other undesired
visitors. I wonder how the Japanese - which are very picky about hygiene
issues, for example they wear a mask when they have flu - can stand these
problems. 

</p>
<p>
  The solution strikes me as lightning obvious. Placing an advanced
  device called "garbage bin" in the streets would eliminate the rotting
  of trash on the apartments' terraces, the proliferation of the friendly
  pets and therefore the need for (unhealthy!) poisons and traps
  scattered through the house. But then again, maybe I can't grasp what
  is the logic behind this.
</p>
<p>
  Oh, some good news. We got one (warning, <a
  href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/censi/58438126/">this photo is
  rather crude</a> ). Nevertheless, the very moment I took the photo of
  the terrace above, I saw another, bigger. War is not over yet.
