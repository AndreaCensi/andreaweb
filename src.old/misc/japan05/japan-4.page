  Since about ten days ago I'm not doing so well here. I had flu with all
  sort of other symptoms. I went to the pharmacy, but here without a
  prescription you can get only homeopathic products - the funny thing is
  that they tell you: just try, there are no contraindications. I really
  felt the need of something with a long list of contraindications,
  therefore I asked Michele (a PhD student of
  the lab), to accompany me to an English-speaking hospital.

	They prescribed me some antibiotics and pain killers. At the pharmacy
  they sold me the exact number of pills I needed, and they presented me
  with a nice paper with photos and posology.

  <p>I spent about 80 euro altogether (will be refunded by my insurance).
</p>
<p>
  I must say that the visit to the hospital was a pleasant experience,
  set aside the long lines (one hour for the visit, one hour to get the
  diagnosis - pharyngitis - written down in english). But so far, Japan
  scores only second in my all-time favourite list of public sanity
  system. The first place goes to Stockholm, Sweden, where 4 years ago I
  had a bad cut cured - I had slipped from <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:The_Little_Mermaid-tourists.jpg">
  the rock</a> of the <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid">Little
  Mermaid</a> in Copenhagen (this sort of things happens only on a <a
  href="http://www.inter-rail.it/">inter-rail</a>). There, the mythical
  "e111 model" provided me with the tender loving care of a doctor and two
  nurses, all blonde, female, typically Swedish, and with a mastery of
  English I will never attain in my lifetime.
</p>
<p>
  I thought that, coming to Tokyo, I would have had the occasion to visit
  all sort of places outside and inside the city, but until now, for the
  jet lag, then for the tiredness of the moving in, then for the illness,
  I spent the most part of my weekends in the house, which is just like
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Auberge_espagnole">l'auberge
  espagnole</a>, only a bit sadder, with a lot of Koreans around and a
  fridge who could easily be classified as a chemical weapon of mass
  destruction ( by the way, have you already seen <a
  href="http://www.rainews24.rai.it/ran24/inchiesta/body.asp">this
  video</a>?).
</p>
<p>
  And now I introduce you to the trusted companion of these sick days.
  From only 80 euro cent (deluxe edition is 2,40 euro), you can get
  lyophilised noodles, which is my only chance to get warm food at the
  gaijin-house without actually cooking.

  In the inside, there are some little plastic bags.

	It is better not to investigate too deeply the content of the plastic
  bags. Just drop it on the noodles.

	Add boiling water and there it is, ready to eat, preferably the
  Japanese way, with a lot of slurping.

  <p>I must say that the taste is surprisingly good for costing only 80
  euro cent. And for once, I'm really delighted of ignoring Kanjis, for
  the real content of the plastic bags shall be unknown to me.
